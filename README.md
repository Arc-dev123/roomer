# 🗝️🗝️ ROOMER 🗝️🗝️

# 🔥🔥 Purpose 🔥🔥:
Roomer is a discord bot which is specifically designed for smaller discord communities such as school club servers, roleplays, et cetra.
This bot can be used to create 'Rooms' (seperate channels for users), if they have the room key role of course. In which they can add or remove users too! Roomer is also open-source and anyone can use it to their liking.

# 🗣️🗣️ Commands 🗣️🗣️:
Roomer has 5 commands in total:
  * /setup (This command is only for users who have **Administrator** permissions in the server. This command sets up the bot so that it can work in the server. Must be   
  used.)
  * /create_room (This command allows a user to create their own room in the server, if they have the room key.)
  * /delete_room (This command allows a user to create their own room in the server, if they have the room key.)
  * /add_user (This command allows a user to add more users into their group using their ID.)
  * /remove_user (This command allows a user to remove users from their group using their ID.)
  * /rewards (This command lets the user to check rewards)
  * /claim (This command lets the user to claim their rewards)

# ⚠️⚠️ Limitations ⚠️⚠️:
  * The bot can only run if it has proper permissions.
  * The bot will not work properly if any channel has been deleted manually.
  * The bot will not work if it's not online.
  * Users in the server who have proper permissions can see your channel even if you have not added them.
  * Discord has a cap of 50 categories and 500 channels for each discord server. Meaning, it won't work properly if the server has reached those numbers.
  * The bot will have bugs however, it will be fixed out throughly.
